# HearMeWell: Emotion Signal Detection and Speech Recognition
HearMeWell is a project that combines advanced deep learning models for emotion detection and speech recognition, tailored for Arabic voice messages. This system aims to enhance communication for individuals with hearing impairments by analyzing emotional tones and converting speech to text.

### Features
Emotion Detection: Classifies emotions into five categories: Happy, Sad, Angry, Disgust, and Calm.
Speech-to-Text: Converts spoken Arabic to readable text using OpenAI's Whisper.
Dual Modeling Approaches:
Numerical-based Features: Extracted from audio signals (MFCCs, ZCR, etc.).
Image-based Features: Mel-spectrograms processed via CNN-BiLSTM and other architectures.
